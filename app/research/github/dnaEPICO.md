The goal of **`dnaEPICO`** is to provide a **modular, reproducible, and
pipeline** for the preprocessing and statistical analysis of Illumina
DNA methylation array data (EPICv2, EPIC and 450K).

The package integrates preprocessing, quality control, phenotype
merging, generalised linear models (GLM), linear mixed-effects models
(LME), and automated report generation. It is designed to run seamlessly
on local machines as well as High-Performance Computing (HPC)
environments via a **GNU Make–based workflow**.

## Installation instructions

Get the latest stable `R` release from
[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). Then install `dnaEPICO` from
[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org/) using the following code:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("dnaEPICO")
```

And the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/paulYRP/dnaEPICO) with:

``` r
BiocManager::install("paulYRP/dnaEPICO")
```
